<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>REPRINTS OF EARLY BIBLES.</h3>

  <p>In 1833 the authorities of the Clarendon Press put forth a quarto
  reprint, word for word, page for page, and letter for letter, of the
  <i>first</i> large black-letter folio edition of 1611, of the present
  authorised or Royal version of the Bible. So accurate was it, that even
  manifest errors of the press were retained. It was published that the
  reader might judge whether the original standard could still be exactly
  followed. It was accompanied by a collation with a <i>smaller</i>
  black-letter folio of 1613, in preference to the larger folio of that
  year, as no two copies (entire) of the latter could be found, all the
  sheets of which corresponded precisely:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Many of these copies contain sheets belonging, as may clearly be
  proved, to editions of more recent date; and even those which appear to
  be still as they were originally published, are made up partly from the
  edition printed at the time, and partly from the remains of earlier
  impressions."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now this is a most interesting subject to all lovers of our dear old
  English Bible. It is supposed the translators revised their work for the
  1613 edition (after two years); yet the collation with the <i>small</i>
  folio of that year, shows little or no improvement, rather the contrary.
  I possess a small quarto edition of 1613 (black-letter, by Barker), not
  mentioned by our more eminent bibliographers, which, while admitting the
  better corrections, adheres to the old 1611 folio, where the <i>small</i>
  folio of 1613 unnecessarily deviates. It is certainly, I consider, a most
  valuable impression. I have lately purchased a magnificent copy of the
  <i>great</i> folio of 1613. It is in the original thick oak binding, with
  huge brass clasps, corners, and bosses; and appears to have been chained
  to a reading-desk. In collating it, I find a sheet or two in 1 Samuel and
  St. Matthew most carefully supplied from an earlier impression. The
  titles both to the Old and New Testaments are exactly the same as those
  of the folio 1611, with the exception of the date 1613 for 1611. It has
  been gloriously used, and the imagination revels in the thought of the
  eyes and hearts that must have been blessed by its perusal. I am not
  sufficiently conversant with our earlier translations to identify,
  without reference, the sheets of the inserted edition, and I have not
  time to refer. I may only say that there is a most quaint woodcut of
  little David slinging a stone at the giant Goliath. A slight collation of
  Genesis shows me this large edition agrees in corrections with the small
  one the Clarendon Press authorities used, though my quarto 1613 differs,
  adhering, as I said before, more closely to the original standard of
  1611. I would put a Query or two to your many readers.</p>

  <p>1. Was the great folio 1613 ever published entire, or are the sheets I
  have indicated supplied in every known copy, some from earlier, some from
  later, impressions? 2. Is it an established fact, that the translators
  revised their work in 1613? 3. What is the small quarto of 1613 I have
  mentioned?</p>

  <p>Lastly, would it not be an interesting enterprise to reprint our
  various translations of the holy volume in a cheap and uniform series,
  like the Parker Society published the Liturgy? A society might be formed
  by subscription to support such an object. We might have Coverdale's,
  Matthews', Cranmer's, Taverner's, the Geneva (1560), the Bishops'
  (Parker's, 1568), and the noble authorised (Royal 1611), with their
  variations noted. I cannot see any harm would arise; and surely it might
  give an impulse to that noblest of all studies, the study of God's Word.
  What grander volume for simplicity and elegance of language, for true
  Anglo-Saxon idiom, than our present venerated translation? What book that
  could interest more than Cranmer's Great Bible of 1539, from whence our
  familiar Prayer-Book version of the Psalms is taken? It would give me
  heartfelt pleasure to contribute my humble efforts in such a cause.</p>

<h3>MARRIAGE LICENCE OF JOHN GOWER THE POET.</h3>

  <p>The following special licence of marriage extracted from the Register
  of William of Wykeham, preserved in the registry at Winchester, is a
  curious document in itself; but if, as there is much reason for
  supposing, the person on whose behalf it was granted was no less a man
  than the illustrious poet&mdash;the "moral Gower"&mdash;the interest
  attached to it is very much enhanced: and for this reason I am desirous
  of giving it publicity through the columns of "N. &amp; Q."&mdash;a fit
  place for recording such pieces of information, relating to the lives of
  men eminent in the annals of literature. I have not been able to find any
  notice of the marriage of John Gower in the books to which I have been
  able to refer; and, though it may be perhaps an event of little
  importance, it is one which a faithful biographer would never omit to
  mention. The document is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Willelmus permissione divina Wyntoniensis Episcopus, dilecto in
  Christo filio, domino Willelmo, capellano parochiali ecclesiæ S. Mariæ
  Magdalenæ in Suthwerk, nostræ diocesis, salutem, gratiam, et
  benedictionem. Ut matrimonium inter Joannem Gower et Agnetem Groundolf
  dictæ ecclesiæ parochianos sine ulteriore bannorum editione, dumtamen
  aliud canonicum non obsistat, extra ecclesiam parochialem, in <!-- Page
  488 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page488"></a>{488}</span>Oratorio
  ipsius Joannis Gower infra hospicium cum in prioratu B. Mariæ de Overee
  in Suthwerk prædicta situatum, solempnizare valeas licenciam tibi tenore
  præsentium, quatenus ad nos attinet, concedimus specialem. In cujus rei
  testimonium sigillum nostrum fecimus his apponi. Dat. in manerio nostro
  de alta clera vicesimo quinto die mensis Januarii, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1397, et nostræ consecrationis 31mo."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The connexion of the poet Gower with the priory of St. Mary Overy is
  well known; as well as his munificence in contributing very largely to
  the reconstruction of the church of the priory, in which he also founded
  a chantry, and where his tomb still exists. It would appear from this
  document, that he actually resided within the priory.</p>

  <p>This marriage must have taken place late in his life. The year of his
  birth is unknown. He is said to have been somewhat older than Chaucer,
  the date of whose birth is also uncertain; there being some grounds for
  assigning it to 1328, others, perhaps more satisfactory, for fixing it
  1345. If the latter be correct, and if we allow for the disparity of age,
  we may suppose Gower to have been somewhere between fifty-five and sixty
  years of age at the time of his marriage with Agnes Groundolf.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">W. H. Gunner.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Winchester.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[A reference to the will of Gower, which is printed in Todd's
  <i>Illustrations of Gower and Chaucer</i>, p. 87. et seq., confirms the
  accuracy of our correspondent's inference, that this is the marriage
  licence of the poet, inasmuch as it shows that the Christian name of
  Gower's wife was Agnes.&mdash;<span class="sc">Ed.</span> "N. &amp;
  Q."]</p>

</div>

<hr class="short" />

<h3>ASKA OR ASCA.</h3>

  <p>Throughout North America this dissyllable is found terminating names
  in localities, occupied at the present day by Indian tribes speaking very
  different languages; and, in these languages, with the exception of such
  names, few analogous sounds exist. There are, besides, names terminating
  in <i>esco</i>, <i>isco</i>, <i>isca</i>, <i>escaw</i>, <i>uscaw</i>,
  which, perhaps, may be placed in the same category, being only accidental
  variations of <i>aska</i>, arising from a difference of ear in those who
  first heard them pronounced by a native tongue.</p>

  <p>Are these names vernacular in any of the modern Indian languages? and,
  if so, what is their real meaning? I propound these questions for
  solution by any of the gentlemen at Fort Chepewyan, Norway House, &amp;c.
  (since, no doubt, "N. &amp; Q." penetrates the Far West as well as the
  Far East), who may feel an interest in the subject.</p>

  <p>Apparently, they have been imposed by a people who occupied the whole
  continent from sea to sea, as they occur from Hudson's Bay to Yucatan,
  and from the Pacific to the Atlantic.</p>

  <p>Were the American nations originally of one tongue? Humboldt, Du
  Ponceau, and others have remarked that striking analogies of grammatical
  construction exist in all American languages, from the Eskimo to the
  Fuegian, although differing entirely in their roots. Dr. Prichard
  says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There are peculiarities in the very nature of the American languages
  which are likely to produce great variety in words, and to obliterate in
  a comparatively short period the traces of resemblance."&mdash;<i>Phys.

</blockquote>

  <p>It may be only a curious coincidence, but it is undoubtedly true,
  that, with scarcely one exception, all names (we might almost say
  <i>words</i>) so terminating are more or less connected with water. The
  exception (if it really be one) is <i>Masca</i>, which I have found among
  my old notes, followed by the word <i>Montagne</i>; but nothing more, and
  I have forgotten all about it.</p>

  <p>For the rest, the varieties in isca, &amp;c., spoken of before, are
  chiefly to be found in the northern countries, towards Hudson's and
  James' Bay, &amp;c., where the present spoken languages are the Eskimo or
  Karalit, the Cree, and the Montagnard dialect of the Algonkin, viz.
  Agomisca, island in James' Bay; Meminisca, lake on Albany River;
  Nemiskau, a lake; Pasquamisco, on James' Bay; then, Keenwapiscaw, lake;
  Naosquiscaw, ditto; Nepiscaw, ditto; Camipescaw, ditto; Caniapuscaw,
  ditto and river: the last five lie between the head waters of the
  Saguenay and the bottom of James' Bay.</p>

  <p>Again, beginning at the extreme west, we find Oonalaska, or Agoun
  Aliaska, or (according to the natives) Nagoun Alaska, an island abounding
  in fine springs and rivulets. Nor should I omit another of the Aleutian
  islands, called Kiska.</p>

  <p>Alaska, or Aliaska, a peninsula. The language in these instances is a
  branch of the Eskimo.</p>

  <p>Athabaska (Atapescow of Malte-Brun), lake and river. M&lsquo;Kenzie
  says that the word means, in the Knistenaux language, a flat, low, swampy
  country, liable to inundations (edit. 4to., p. 122.). Here I repeat the
  question, is the word vernacular, or only adopted? In such vocabularies
  as I have seen, there is nothing bearing the slightest relationship to
  it. In one given by Dr. Latham (<i>Varieties of Man</i>, &amp;c., pp.
  208-9.), water, in the Chepewyan, is <i>tone</i>, and river,
  <i>tesse</i>.</p>

  <p>Itaska, the small lake whence the Mississippi has its origin. The
  languages prevalent in the adjacent country would be the Sioux, and the
  Chippeway branch of the Algonquino.</p>

  <p>Wapiscow, river. Language, Cree?</p>

  <p>Nebraska, "The Shallow River," said to be the name of the Platte in
  the Sioux language.</p>

  <p>Mochasko, "Always full;" another river so called in the Sioux. Query,
  Are these two vernacular? Watapan is river in that language. <!-- Page
  489 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page489"></a>{489}</span></p>

  <p>Oanoska is a Sioux word, meaning "The Great Avenue or Stretch;" but
  whether it applies to a river I have forgotten. The quotation is from
  Long's <i>Expedit. to St. Peter's River</i>, vol. i. p 339., to which I
  have not access just now. Atamaska and Madagaska are two names of which I
  can give no account, for the same reason as stated above at Maska.</p>

  <p>Arthabaska is (or was) a very swampy township so named, lying south of
  the St Lawrence.</p>

  <p>Maskinonge (also the name of a fish) in which the sound occurs,
  although not as a termination, is a seigneurie on the north bank of the
  St Lawrence, of which the part near the river is so low that it is
  inundated frequently. A river of the same name runs through this
  seigneurie. Both the foregoing are in the country where the Iroquois
  language prevailed.</p>

  <p>Zoraska, or Zawraska, name of a river somewhere between Quebec and
  James' Bay, of which I know nothing more, having only heard it spoken of
  by moose-hunters. Probably it is in a country where the language would be
  the Montagnard.</p>

  <p>Yamaska, a river on the south side of the St. Lawrence, having much
  marshy ground about it, particularly near its junction with the Grand
  River.</p>

  <p>Kamouraska, or Camouraska, islands in the St. Lawrence below Quebec,
  taking their name from a seigneurie on the mainland; a level plain
  surrounded by hills, and dotted all over with mounds. Bouchette
  says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"D'après la position, l'apparence, et l'exacte ressemblance de ces
  espèces d'îles en terre-firme avec celles de Camouraska, entre lesquelles
  et le rivage le lit de la rivière est presqu'à sec à la marée basse, le
  naturaliste sera fortement porté à croire que ce qui forme à présent le
  continent était, à une époque quelconque, submergé par les vagues
  immenses du St Laurent, et que les élévations en question formaient des
  îles, ou des rochers exposés à l'action de l'eau,"
  &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Description de Bas-Canada, &amp;c.</i>, p. 551.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There can be no doubt, if <i>aska</i> relate to water, that this
  district is appropriately named.</p>

  <p>We may presume the language prevalent here to have been the Algonquin,
  since the inhabitants, when first visited by Europeans, were either the
  Micmac or Abenaqui, both tribes of that great family.</p>

  <p>Still further eastward, flowing from Lake Temisconata into the River
  St. John, we find the Madawaska, in a country where the language was
  either the Abenaqui, or a dialect of the Huron, said to be spoken by the
  Melicite Indians of the St. John. Aska does not occur again in this part
  of North America, as far as I call ascertain; but on looking southward it
  does so, and under similar circumstances, viz. associated with water.</p>

  <p>Tabasca, or Tobasco (for it is written both ways), a country on the
  borders of Yucatan, described by the conquerors as difficult to march
  through, on account of numerous pools of water and extensive swamps.
  Clavigero says the present name was given by the Spaniards; but I know of
  no Spanish word at all resembling it, therefore presume they must have
  adopted the native appellation. The language was, and perhaps is, the
  Maya.</p>

  <p>Tarasca; name of a people inhabiting the country of Mechouacan,
  celebrated for its numerous fountains of fine water. Language appears to
  have been Mexican. (See Clavigero, vol. i. p. 10., edit. 4to., Cullen's
  <i>Trans.</i>; and Dr. Prichard's <i>Phys. Hist.</i>, &amp;c., vol. v. p.
  340.)</p>

  <p>The mention of Tarasca reminds one of Tarascon, also written Tarasca.
  Two instances occur in the country of Celtic Gaul; both on rivers: the
  one on the Rhone, the other on the Arriège.</p>

  <p>Having for the present finished with America, one is naturally led to
  inquire whether <i>asca</i> occurs in other parts of the world, in like
  manner associated with water. Before doing so, however, I would observe
  that Thompson, in his <i>Essay on Etymologies</i>, &amp;c., p. 10.,
  remarks that "The Gothic termination <i>sk</i>, the origin of our
  <i>ish</i>, the Saxon <i>isk</i>, signifying <i>assimilated</i>,
  <i>identified</i>, is used in all dialects, to the very shores of China,"
  &amp;c. He instances "Tobolsk" and "Uvalsk." If, then, it be true that
  <i>&#x101;</i> and <i>&#x101;b</i> are primitive sounds denoting water in
  many languages, may we not here have a combination of <i>&#x101;</i> and
  <i>sk</i>?</p>

  <p>But to proceed. Malte Brun mentions a city in Arabia called "Asca,"
  one of the places sacked by the expedition under Elius Gallus (<i>Précis
  de la Géographie</i>, &amp;c., vol. i. p. 179.). Generally speaking,
  Arabia is not abounding in waters; but that very circumstance renders
  celebrated, more or less, every locality where they do abound and are
  pure. The city, therefore, might have been notable for its walls and
  fountains of pure water.</p>

  <p>Aska is the name of a river in Japan, remarkable for its great depth,
  and for frequently changing its course (Golownin, vol. iii. p. 149.).</p>

  <p>In north-eastern Asia we find a river called after the Tongouse,
  <i>Tongousca</i>. Query, Tungouse-asca? and, following up Thompson's
  examples before mentioned, we may name Yakutsk, Irkutsk, Ochotsk,
  Kamtchatka, &amp;c., all intimately connected with water. Then there is
  Kandalask, a gulf of the White Sea; Tchesk, another; Kaniska-Zemblia, an
  island, &amp;c. In Spain, Huesca is on the river Barbato. The two
  Gradiskas in Hungary, &amp;c. are the one on the Sâve, the other on the
  Lisonzo.</p>

  <p>Zaleski (Pereslav) is seated on a lake; but Malte-Brun says the name
  means "au-delà des bois." This may or may not be the case. The sound is
  here, and in connexion with water. Pultusk is nearly surrounded by water,
  the Narew. Askersan, in Sweden, stands on a lake. Gascon, <!-- Page 490
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page490"></a>{490}</span>says
  Rafinesque, means "beyond the sea" (<i>American Nations</i>, &amp;c., No.
  2. p. 41.).</p>

  <p>Madagascar. Curious the similarity between this name of an island and
  the American names Madagaska and Madawaska. By the way, I forgot to
  notice of this last, that Captain Levinge, in his <i>Echoes from the Back
  Woods</i>, &amp;c., vol. i. p. 150., derives it from Madawas (Micmac), a
  "porcupine;" whilst <i>The Angler in Canada</i> (Lanman), p. 229., says
  that it means "never frozen," because part of the river never freezes.
  Which is right?</p>

  <p>Tcherkask. Every one knows that the capital of the Don Cossacks is
  eminently a water city. According to Pallas, the Circassians
  (Tcherkesses) once were located in the Crimea. They may have extended
  their influence to the Don, and the name in question may be a synthetic
  form of Tcherkesse-aska.</p>

  <p>Damasca (Latinised Damascus) is famed all over the East for its
  waters. The name of the ancient city was Damas, "Le Demechk, ou
  Chamel-Dimichk, des Orientaux" (Malte-Brun, viii. 215.).</p>

  <p>The modern city is said to be called Damas, or I Domeschk, though it
  seems more generally known as El Sham. Bryant says it was called by the
  natives <i>Damasec</i> and <i>Damakir</i>, the latter meaning the city
  (Caer?) of Dams, or of Adama (<i>Mythology</i>, &amp;c., vol. i. p. 69.).
  Can it have once been Adama, or Dama-asca?</p>

  <p>In Great Britain we have rivers and lakes called severally Esk, Exe or
  Isca, Axe, and Usk.</p>

  <p>Axe seems to have been written <i>Asca</i> at one time; for Lambarde
  gives Ascanmynster as the Saxon name of Axminster. Hence, also, we may
  infer that Axholme Island was once Ascanholme. The Exe was probably Esk,
  <i>i.e.</i> water, or river: it certainly was Uske. Iska is the British
  Isk Latinised by Ptolemy; for Camden says Exeter was called by the Welsh
  <i>Caerisk</i>, &amp;c. Usk or Uske was written <i>Osca</i> by Gyraldo
  Camb. (See Lambarde.)</p>

  <p>Kyleska, or Glendha, ferry in Sutherlandshire. Kyle-aska? Kyles (Ir.),
  a frith or strait.</p>

  <p>Ask occurs frequently as the first syllable of names in England, and
  such places will be almost invariably found connected with water. Camden
  mentions a family of distinguished men in Richmondshire named Aske, from
  whom perhaps some places derive their names, as <i>p. ex.</i> the
  Askhams, Askemoore, &amp;c. Askrigg, however, being in the neighbourhood
  of some remarkable waterfalls (Camden), may have reference to them.</p>

  <p>Now, from places let us turn to things, first noticing that
  <i>usk</i>, in modern Welsh, means river. In Irish, <i>uisce</i> or
  <i>uiske</i> is water. In Hebrew and Chaldee, <i>hisca</i> is to wash or
  to drink. (See Introduction to Valancey's <i>Irish Dictionary</i>.) In
  the same we find <i>ascu</i> (ancient Irish), a water-serpent or dog;
  <i>iasc</i>, fish; <i>easc</i> (Irish), water, same as <i>esk</i>.
  Chalmers, in "Caledonia," &amp;c., has easc or esc (Gael.), water;
  <i>easc lan</i> (Gael.), the full water.</p>

  <p>Askalabos (Greek), a newt or water reptile; and asker, askard, askel,
  ask, and esk, in provincial English, a water-newt. (See <i>Archaic
  Dictionary</i>.)</p>

  <p>Masca, the female sea-otter; so called by the Russians.</p>

  <p>Askalopas (Greek), a woodcock or snipe, <i>i.e.</i> a swamp-bird.</p>

  <p>As I said before, there are few words in any of the Indian languages
  of North America in which the sound <i>ask</i> occurs; at least as far as
  my limited acquaintance with them goes. The only two I can quote just now
  are both in the Chippeway. One only has direct reference to water;
  perhaps the other may indirectly. They are, <i>woyzask</i>, rushes,
  water-plants; <i>mejask</i>, herb, or grass. The only grass the forest
  Indians are likely to be acquainted with is that growing in the natural
  meadows along the river banks, which are occasionally met with, and these
  in general are pretty swampy.</p>

  <p>We may wind up with our <i>cask</i> and <i>flask</i>. I could have
  added much more, but fear already to have exceeded what might hope for
  admittance in your pages; therefore I will only say that, in offering
  these remarks, I insist on nothing, and stand ready to submit to any
  correction.</p>

<h3>LEGENDS OF THE COUNTY CLARE.</h3>

  <p>About two miles from the village of Corofin, in the west of Clare, are
  the ruins of the Castle of Ballyportree, consisting of a massive square
  tower surrounded by a wall, at the corners of which are smaller round
  towers: the outer wall was also surrounded by a ditch. The castle is
  still so far perfect that the lower part is inhabited by a farmer's
  family; and in some of the upper rooms are still remaining massive
  chimney-pieces of grey limestone, of a very modern form, the horizontal
  portions of which are ornamented with a quatrefoil ornament engraved
  within a circle, but there are no dates or armorial bearings: from the
  windows of the castle four others are visible, none of them more than two
  miles from each other; and a very large cromlech is within a few yards of
  the castle ditch. The following legend is related of the
  castle:&mdash;When the Danes were building the castle (the Danes were the
  great builders, as Oliver Cromwell was the great destroyer of all the old
  castles, abbeys, &amp;c. in Ireland),&mdash;when the Danes were building
  the Castle of Ballyportree, they collected workmen from all quarters, and
  forced them to labour night and day without stopping for rest or food;
  and according as any of them fell down from exhaustion, his body was
  thrown upon the wall, which was built up over him! When <!-- Page 491
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page491"></a>{491}</span>the castle was
  finished, its inhabitants tyrannised over the whole country, until the
  time arrived when the Danes were finally expelled from Ireland.
  Ballyportree Castle held out to the last, but at length it was taken
  after a fierce resistance, only three of the garrison being found alive,
  who proved to be a father and his two sons; the infuriated conquerors
  were about to kill them also, when one of then proposed that their lives
  should be spared, and a free passage to their own country given them, on
  condition that they taught the Irishmen how to brew the famous ale from
  the heather&mdash;that secret so eagerly coveted by the Irish, and so
  zealously guarded by the Danes. At first neither promises nor threats had
  any effect on the prisoners, but at length the elder warrior consented to
  tell the secret on condition that his two sons should first be put to
  death before his eyes, alleging his fear, that when he returned to his
  own country, they might cause him to be put to death for betraying the
  secret. Though somewhat surprised at his request, the Irish chieftains
  immediately complied with it, and the young men were slain. Then the old
  warrior exclaimed, "Fools! I saw that your threats and your promises were
  beginning to influence my sons; for they were but boys, and might have
  yielded: but now the secret is safe, your threats or your promises have
  no effect on me!" Enraged at their disappointment, the Irish soldiers
  hewed the stern northman in pieces, and the coveted secret is still
  unrevealed.</p>

  <p>In the South of Scotland a legend, almost word for word the same as
  the above, is told of an old castle there, with the exception that,
  instead of Danes, the old warrior and his sons are called Pechts. After
  the slaughter of his sons the old man's eyes are put out, and he is left
  to drag on a miserable existence: he lives to an immense old age, and one
  day, when all the generation that fought with him have passed away, he
  hears the young men celebrating the feats of strength performed by one of
  their number; the old Pecht asks for the victor, and requests him to let
  him feel his wrist; the young man feigns compliance with his request, but
  places an iron crow-bar in the old man's hand instead of his wrist; the
  old Pecht snaps the bar of iron in two with his fingers, remarking
  quietly to the astounded spectators, that "it is a gey bit gristle, and
  has not much pith in it yet." The story is told in the second volume of
  Chambers's <i>Edinburgh Journal</i>, first series, I think; but I have
  not the volume at hand to refer to. The similarity between the two
  legends is curious and interesting.</p>

<h3>ARCHAIC WORDS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 400., &amp;c.)</p>

  <p>The following list of words, which do not appear in Mr. Halliwell's
  <i>Dictionary of Archaic Words</i>, may form some contribution, however
  small, to the enlargement of that and of some of our more comprehensive
  English dictionaries. It falls in with the desire already expressed in
  "N. &amp; Q.;" and, if the present paper seem worth inserting, may be
  followed by another. In some few cases, though the word does appear in
  Mr. Halliwell's columns, an authority is deficient; instances having as
  it were turned up, and in rather uncommon sources, which seemed
  occasionally worth supplying. It must be observed that the explanations
  given are, in some instances, mere conjectures, and await more certain
  and accurate interpretation.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Celtic Language.</span>&mdash;As <i>fraus latet in
  generalibus</i> in linguistics as in law, I beg to suggest that, instead
  of using the word <i>Celtic</i>, the words <i>Gaelic</i>, <i>Cymbric</i>,
  <i>Breton</i>, <i>Armorican</i>, <i>Welsh</i>, <i>Irish</i>, &amp;c.
  might be properly appropriated. The mother Celtic is lost,&mdash;her
  remains are to be found only in the names of mountains, rivers, and
  countries; and our knowledge of this tongue is derived from an
  acquaintance with her two principal daughters, the Gaelic and Cymbric
  (=Kymric). The Gaelic tongue has been driven by Germanic invasion into
  Ireland (Erse), and into the Highlands of Scotland (Gaelic). The Cymbric
  tongue first took refuge in Belgium, known afterwards as Breton, and
  still lives as Welsh and Bas-Breton, which (and not the Gaelic) is
  nearest of kin in some words to the Latin and Italian.</p>

  <p>To understand this subject, the profound induction of Eichhoff must be

  <p>I observe that in Chalmers' Dictionary the mother of Locke is called
  Anne, whereas, in the Wrington register, I am informed that it appears as
  Agnes,&mdash;"1630, July 15, (married) John Locke and Agnes Keene." I
  believe, however, that in former days Anne and Agnes were not
  unfrequently confounded, so that the apparent discrepancy may not be
  material.</p>

  <p>The best evidence that is at present within my reach, in support of
  the connexion here given, is a letter from Mrs. Frances Watkins, a
  daughter of either Samuel or John Keene, dated "Abingdon, January, 1754,"
  addressed to her son "Joseph Watkins, Esq., at John's Coffee House,
  Cornhill, London," and from which I make the following extract for the
  information of those who may be disposed to look into this question. She
  says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I am allied to Mr. Lock thus: His father and my grandmother were
  brother and sister, and his mother and my grandfather were also sister
  and brother, consequently my father and the great Lock were doubly first
  cousins. My grandfather's sister and my grandmother's brother produced
  this wonder of the world. To make you more sensible of it, a Lock married
  a Keen, and a Keen married a Lock. My aunt Keen was a most beautiful
  woman, as was all the family; and my uncle Lock an extream wise man. So
  much for genealogy. My Lord Chancellor King was allied thus near. I
  forgett whether his mother was a Keen or Lock. I had this information
  from my aunt Darby. Mr. Lock had no advantage in his person, but was a
  very fine gentleman. From foreign Courts they used to write, 'For John
  Lock, Esq., in England.'"</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p>"<i>The Village Lawyer.</i>"&mdash;Can you inform me who is the author
  of that very popular farce, <i>The Village Lawyer</i>? It was first acted
  about the year 1787. It has been ascribed to Mr. Macready, the father of
  Mr. W.&nbsp;C. Macready, the eminent tragedian. The real author, however, is
  said to have been a dissenting minister in Dublin, and I would be obliged
  to any of your readers who could give me his name.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Sigma.</span></p>

  <p><i>Richard Plantagenet, Earl of Cambridge.</i>&mdash;In a note in the
  first volume of Miss Strickland's <i>Lives of the Queens of Scotland</i>,
  she remarks that Bourchier, Earl of Essex, "was near of kin to the royal
  family, being grand-nephew to Richard, Duke of York, father of Edward
  IV., but did not share the blood of the heiress of March, <i>Jane</i>
  Mortimer." I quote from memory, not having the book at hand; but allowing
  that Jane for Anne may be a slip of the pen, or a mistake of the press,
  where did Miss Strickland discover any second marriage of Richard, Earl
  of Cambridge? All pedigrees of the royal family that I have seen agree in
  giving him only one wife, and in expressly stating her to be mother to
  Isabel, Countess of Essex.</p>

  <p><i>Highland Regiment.</i>-Can any of your Gaelic or military
  correspondents inform me whether it is at present the custom for the
  officers in the Highland regiments to wear a dirk in addition to the
  broadsword? Also whether the Highland regiments were ever armed with
  broadswords, and <!-- Page 494 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page494"></a>{494}</span>whether their drill is different to that
  of the other troops of the line? I have somewhere heard it said that the
  28th (an English regiment) were once armed with swords, whence their name
  of "The Slashers?" Is this the real origin of the name? and if not, what
  is? I should also like to know the origin of the custom of wearing

  <p><i>Ominous Storms.</i>&mdash;A remark by a labouring man of this town

  criminals to be hanged, there are always winds and storms, and roaring

  <p><i>Boyle Family.</i>&mdash;Allow me to repeat the Query regarding
  Richard Boyle (Vol. vii., p. 430.). Richard Boyle, appointed Dean of
  Limerick 5th Feb. 1661, and Bishop of Leighlin and Ferns in 1666, died in
  1682. Roger Boyle, the youngest brother of Richard, was born in 1617, and
  educated in Trinity College, Dublin, of which he became a Fellow. On the
  breaking out of the rebellion of 1641 he went to England, and having
  become tutor to Lord Paulet, he continued in that family till the
  Restoration, when he returned to Ireland, and was presented with the
  Rectory of Carrigaline, diocese of Cork. He was made Dean of Cork in
  1662, and promoted to the Bishopric of Down and Connor 12th Sept. 1667.
  He was translated to Clogher, 21st September, 1672, and died 26th
  November, 1687. The sister of these prelates was wife to the Rev. Urban
  Vigors (Vol. viii., p. 340.). They were near relatives of the great Earl
  of Cork, and many of their descendants have been buried in his tomb, in
  St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. I have not seen any reply to my Query
  about Mr. Vigors. May I ask is there any list of the chaplains of King
  Charles I.?</p>

  "A'Becket" in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, xciii. 349.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"These words goaded the king into one of those paroxysms of fury to

  <p>The following is from Thierry, tom. iii. p. 330., Paris, 1830:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"L'on racontait d'une ancienne Comtesse d'Anjou, aieule du père de
  Henri II., que son mari ayant remarqué avec effroi, qu'elle allait
  rarement à l'église, et qu'elle en sortait toujours à la sacre de la
  messe, s'avisa de l'y faire retenir de force par quatre écuyers; mais
  qu'à l'instant de la consécration, la Comtesse, jettant le manteau par
  lequel on la tenait, s'était envolée par une fenêtre, et n'avait jamais
  reparu. Richard de Poictiers, selon un contemporain, avait coutume de
  rapporter cette aventure, et de dire à ce propos: 'Est-il étonnant que,
  sortis d'une telle source, nous vivions mal, les uns avec les autres? Ce
  qui provient du diable doit retourner au diable.'"</p>

  notice. My affinity was that of a cousin, not uncle, to the late lord my
  predecessor. I never had the military rank assigned to me, but was at the
  time like <span class="sc">Traveller</span> himself, a "youngster"
  freshly emancipated from Oxford to the Continent: and had little more
  pretension in printing the extracts from my Journal, than to comply with
  the kind wishes of many friends and relatives.</p>

  <p>But to pass to what is more important, the character of Brydone, at
  the time I speak of there were no useful <i>handbooks</i> in existence;
  and tourists took for the purpose such volumes of travels as they could
  carry. Brydone, for this, was unfit. The French criticism (quoted Vol.
  ix., 306.) rightly says, that he sacrificed truth to piquancy in his
  narrations. Still it is a heavy charge to suspect so gross a deviation,
  as that of inventing the description of an ascent which he never
  accomplished; especially when the ascent is a feat not at all difficult.
  The evidence for this disbelief must be derived from a series of errors
  in the account, which I do not remember to have observed while reading
  him on the spot. The charitable supposition of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Macray</span>, that he mistook the summit, is hardly compatible with so
  defined a cone as that of Etna; but all must agree with his just estimate
  of that description, and which the <i>Biographie Universelle</i> itself
  terms "chef d'&oelig;uvre de narration." Brydone, no doubt, is as unsafe
  for the road as he is amusing for the study, and perhaps from that very
  reason.</p>

<h3>COLERIDGE'S UNPUBLISHED MSS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iv., p. 411.; Vol. vi., p. 533.; Vol. viii.,
p. 43.)</p>

  <p>When I sent you my Note on this subject at the last of the above
  references, I had not read <i>Letters, Conversations, and Recollections
  of S.&nbsp;T. Coleridge</i>, Moxon, 1836. The subjoined extracts from that
  work confirm that note, vol. i, pp. 104. 156. 162.</p>

  <p>August 8, 1820. Coleridge:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I at least am as well as I ever am, and my regular employment, in
  which Mr. Green is weekly my amanuensis, [is] the work on the books of
  the Old and New Testaments, introduced by the assumptions and postulates
  required as the preconditions of a fair examination of Christianity as a
  scheme of doctrines, precepts, and histories, drawn or at least deducible
  from these books."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>January, 1821. Coleridge:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In addition to these &mdash;&mdash; of my <span class="scac">GREAT
  WORK,</span> to the preparation of which more than twenty years of my
  life have been devoted, and on which my hopes of extensive and permanent
  utility, of fame, in the noblest sense of the word, mainly rest, &amp;c.
  Of this work, &amp;c., the result must finally be revolution of all that
  has been called <i>Philosophy</i> or Metaphysics in England and France
  since the era of the commencing predominance of the mechanical system at
  the restoration of our second Charles, and with the present fashionable
  views, not only of religion, morals, and politics, but even of the modern
  physics and physiology.... Of this work, something more than a volume has
  been <!-- Page 497 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  press, to my friend and enlightened pupil, Mr. Green; and more than as
  much again would have been evolved and delivered to paper, but that for
  the last six or eight months I have been compelled to break off our
  weekly meeting," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Vol. ii. p. 219. Editor:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The prospectus of these lectures (viz. on Philosophy) is so full of
  interest, and so well worthy of attention, that I subjoin it; trusting
  that the Lectures themselves will soon be furnished by, or under the
  auspices of Mr. Green, the most constant and the most assiduous of his
  disciples. That gentleman will, I earnestly hope&mdash;<i>and doubt
  not</i>&mdash;see, <i>feel</i>, the necessity of giving the whole of his
  great master's views, opinions, and anticipations; not those alone in
  which he more entirely sympathises, or those which may have more ready
  acceptance in the present time. He will not shrink from the great, the
  <i>sacred duty</i> he has voluntarily undertaken, from any regards of
  prudence, still less from that most hopeless form of fastidiousness, the
  wish to conciliate those who are never to be conciliated, <i>inferior
  minds</i> smarting under a sense of inferiority, and the imputation
  <i>which they are conscious is just</i>, that but for Him <i>they</i>
  never could have been; that distorted, dwarfed, changed, as are all his
  views and opinions, by passing <i>athwart</i> minds with which they could
  not assimilate, they are yet almost the only things which give such minds
  a <i>status</i> in literature."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>How has Mr. Green discharged the duties of this solemn trust? Has he
  made any attempt to give publicity to the <i>Logic</i>, the "great work"
  on <i>Philosophy</i>, the work on the Old and New Testaments, to be
  called <i>The Assertion of Religion</i>, or the <i>History of
  Philosophy</i>, all of which are in his custody, and of which the first
  is, on the testimony of Coleridge himself, a finished work? We know from
  the <i>Letters</i>, vol. ii. pp. 11. 150., that the <i>Logic</i> is an
  essay in three parts, viz. the "Canon," the "Criterion," and the
  "Organon;" of these the last only can be in any respect identical with
  the <i>Treatise on Method</i>. There are other works of Coleridge
  missing; to these I will call attention in a future Note. For the four
  enumerated above Mr. Green is responsible. He has lately received the
  homage of the University of Oxford in the shape of a D.C.L.; he can
  surely afford a fraction of the few years that may still be allotted to
  him in re-creating the fame of, and in discharging his duty to, his great
  master. If, however, he cannot afford the time, trouble, and cost of the
  undertaking, I make him this public offer; I will, myself, take the
  responsibility of the publication of the above-mentioned four works, if
  he will entrust me with the MSS.</p>

  <p>The Editor will, I doubt not, be good enough to forward to the learned
  Doctor a copy of the Number in which this appeal is published.</p>

<h3>MR. JUSTICE TALFOURD AND DR. BEATTIE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p 393.)</p>

  <p>There is so much similarity of character, in respect of sympathy for
  the humbler position and the well-being of others, between this lamented
  judge and that of the professor who is depicted by his biographer in the
  following extract, that I hope you will agree with me in thinking it
  worthy of being framed, and hung up as a companion-sketch in your
  pages:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As a Professor, not his own class only, but the whole body of
  students at the University, looked up to him with esteem and veneration.
  The profound piety of the public prayers, with which he began the
  business of each day, arrested the attention of the youngest and most
  thoughtless; the excellence of his moral character; his gravity blended
  with cheerfulness, his strictness joined with gentleness, his favour to
  the virtuous and diligent, and even the mildness of his reproofs to those
  who were less attentive, rendered him the object of their respect and
  admiration. Never was more exact discipline preserved than in his class,
  nor ever anywhere by more gentle means. His sway was absolute, because it
  was founded in reason and affection. He never employed a harsh epithet in
  finding fault with any of his pupils; and when, instead of a rebuke which
  they were conscious they deserved, they met merely with a mild reproof,
  it was conveyed in such a manner as to throw not only the delinquent, but
  sometimes the whole class into tears. To gain his favour was the highest
  ambition of every student; and the gentlest word of disapprobation was a
  punishment, to avoid which, no exertion was deemed too much. His great
  object was not merely to make his pupils philosophers, but to render them
  good men, pious Christians, loyal to their king, and attached to the
  British constitution; pure in morals, happy in the consciousness of a
  right conduct, and friends to all mankind."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is the language of Dr. Beattie's biographer, who knew him
  intimately. Cowper, the poet, thus writes of him to the Rev. W. Unwin,
  from a knowledge of his works:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I thanked you in my last for Johnson; I now thank you with more
  emphasis for Beattie&mdash;the most agreeable and amiable writer I ever
  met with&mdash;the only author I have seen whose critical and
  philosophical researches are diversified and embellished by a poetical
  imagination, that makes even the driest subject, and the leanest, a feast
  for an epicure in books. He is so much at his ease too, that his own
  character appears in every page; and, which is rare, we see not only the
  writer, but the man; and that man so gentle, so well-tempered, so happy
  in his religion, and so humane in his philosophy, that it is necessary to
  love him, if one has any sense of what is lovely."&mdash;<i>Life of Dr.
  Beattie</i>, by Sir William Forbes, Bart.</p>

  <p class="address">Lichfield.</p>

  <p>In answer to your correspondent <span class="sc">Honoré de
  Marevelle's</span> Query regarding the <i>Te Deum</i> as sung in Russia,
  I beg to inform him that in whatever language the Emperor Nicholas is
  most familiar with this hymn, it is sung in all their churches in
  Sclavonic, which is only intelligible to the priests and a <i>very
  small</i> number of the laity, the mass of the people being quite
  ignorant of this old language. All the services in Russian churches are
  performed in Sclavonic.</p>

  <p>The <i>Old</i> Testament is not permitted to be read by the people in
  modern Russ, by command of the Emperor; it is circulated sparingly in
  Sclavonic, which is of course useless to most of the people, for the
  reason named above. The <i>New</i> Testament is, however, allowed to
  circulate in modern Russ, and not <i>half</i> the population read that,
  perhaps not more than a third.</p>

  <p>With regard to their images or pictures (alluded to by me in Vol.
  viii., p. 582.), I had not only perused the works mentioned by G.&nbsp;W.
  (Vol. ix., p. 86.) before I wrote about the Russian religion, &amp;c.,
  but several other works besides.<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Having been in the country for some little time, and paid some
  attention to the subject, I was certainly surprised to find little, if
  any, mention made of their manner of worship or superstitious customs in
  Dr. Blackmore's works, and wished to contribute my mite towards giving
  your readers some information as to the state of this semi-civilised
  race.</p>

  <p>From <i>Translations of Russian Works</i> you can glean nothing but
  what the Russian government chooses, as every work goes through a severe
  censorship before it is allowed to be printed for circulation; and if
  there is anything in it that is not liked, it is not permitted to be
  published unless those parts are suppressed.</p>

  <p>It is perhaps only partially known that there is some difficulty in
  getting English books and newspapers into Russia, as all must go through
  the censor's office. <i>The Times</i> (which is however all but, if not
  quite, prohibited at St. Petersburg, and has been so a long time),
  <i>Punch</i>, and other of our papers, possess a ludicrous appearance
  after having passed through the hands of the worthies in the censor's
  office, sometimes there being very little left of them to read.</p>

  <p>Whilst writing about images, I omitted to name one or two other
  circumstances that have come under my own notice, showing still farther
  the superstitious veneration in which they are held by the Russians.</p>

  <p>In the case of a house on fire, one of the inmates, with his head
  uncovered, carries the image three times round the burning house, under
  the <!-- Page 499 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page499"></a>{499}</span>belief that it will cause the fire to
  cease, never attempting to put it out by any other means.</p>

  <p>At Moscow there is a very noted image of the Virgin Mary; it is
  deposited in a recess at one side of an archway leading to the Kremlin.
  Every person passing through this archway is <i>obliged</i> to uncover
  his head. I had to do so whenever I passed through. The belief of the
  efficacy of this image in healing diseases is universal. When any person
  is ill, by paying the priests handsomely, they will bring it with great
  pomp, in a carriage and four horses, to the sick person's house, who
  <i>must</i> recover, or else, if death ensues, they say it is <i>so
  fated</i>.</p>

  <p>Instances of other images in various parts of the empire, some
  believed to have fallen from heaven, might be multiplied to any extent. I
  mention these to show that, whatever these representations of the Deity
  may be called, I had not written unadvisedly previously, as might be
  surmised by G.&nbsp;W.'s remarks. Everybody must deplore the wretched
  condition of these people; and the Czar, well knowing their superstitious
  ideas, works upon their fanatical minds with such letters as we all have
  had the sorrow of seeing a specimen of in <i>The Times</i> of to-day.<a

<h3>ARTESIAN WELLS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 222.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Stylites</span> is strongly
  advised not to set about making, or rather endeavouring to make, a well
  of this description till he has been well advised of the feasibility of
  the scheme in his particular locality. The old adage will apply in this
  case, "Ex quovis ligno," &amp;c. It is not everywhere that an artesian
  well can be obtained with any depth of bore; that is, a well which shall
  bring its water to or above the surface of the ground. But if, on
  sufficient knowledge of the mineralogical structure of the country, it be
  declared that a well of the true artesian sort cannot be obtained, <span
  class="sc">Stylites</span> should dig his well, say fifteen or twenty
  feet deep, and "stein" it, and then bore in search of a spring, unless a
  sufficient supply is already obtained from the surface drainage. A
  moderate outlay in this way, unless the impervious stratum be of very
  great thickness indeed, will generally bring up water, with a natural
  tendency to rise within reach of a common pump, or of a well-bucket at
  the least.</p>

  <p>But it may still happen that the water of the bore has not this
  natural tendency. In that case the sinking of the well may be continued
  till the water is reached, and a sufficient depth of reservoir obtained
  at the bottom.</p>

  <p class="author">M. (2)</p>

  <p>As practical answers to the inquiries of <span
  class="sc">Stylites</span> on this subject, I have to say, that common
  wells are preferable to artesian in all cases where abundance of water is
  obtained at a depth not exceeding thirty feet. I need not tell <span
  class="sc">Stylites</span> that the common sucking-pump will not draw up
  water from a depth exceeding thirty feet. The convenience of common wells
  is one reason why artesian ones are not universally adopted; and a
  greater reason is that artesian wells are very much more expensive to
  make than common ones. When artesian wells are preferable to common ones
  is, when water cannot be obtained at a depth beyond the reach of the
  force-pump. Two of my friends have made artesian wells; one a
  mill-spinner at Dundee, at a time when that town was very ill supplied
  with water. He sunk a well 150 feet in depth and found no water. A bore
  was then made through trap rock for upwards of 150 feet, and water was
  found in abundance on reaching the underlying sandstone. The water
  ultimately reached near to the top of the well. The other well was made
  by a bleacher in the neighbourhood of Lisburn in Ireland. All the surface
  springs in his bleaching-grounds, which are extensive, did not supply a
  sufficient quantity for his purposes. The subsoil being boulder clay, he
  had to bore through it to about 300 feet before the water was met with;
  when it rose as near the top of the bore as to permit the use of a common
  pump being worked by power. The theory of the action of artesian wells
  has been explained by <span class="sc">Mr. Buckton</span> (Vol. ix., p.
  283.), but I have no hesitation in telling <span
  class="sc">Stylites</span> that he will find water almost anywhere in
  this country by means of an artesian bore.</p>

<h3>DOG-WHIPPERS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 349.)</p>

  <p>The following Notes may contain information for your correspondent
  C.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;W. on the subject of dog-whippers.</p>

  <p>Richard Dovey, of Farmcote in Shropshire, in the year 1659, charged
  certain cottages with the payment of eight shillings to some poor man of
  the parish of Claverley, who should undertake to awaken sleepers, and
  <i>whip dogs from the church</i> during divine service. Ten shillings and
  sixpence per annum is now paid for the above service.</p>

  <p>John Rudge by his will, dated in 1725, gave five shillings a quarter
  to a poor man to go about the parish church of Trysull, in Staffordshire,
  during sermon, to keep people awake, and <i>keep dogs out of the
  church</i>. This sum is still paid for that purpose.</p>

  <p>At Chislet, in Kent, is a piece of land called "Dog-whipper's Marsh,"
  about two acres, out of <!-- Page 500 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page500"></a>{500}</span>which the tenants pay ten shillings a year
  to a person for <i>keeping order in the church</i> during divine
  service.</p>

  <p>There is an acre of land in the parish of Peterchurch, Herefordshire,
  appropriated to the use of a person for <i>keeping dogs out of the
  church</i>.</p>

  <p>In the parish of Christchurch, Spitalfields, there is a charity fund
  called "cat and dog money," the interest on which is now divided annually
  amongst six poor widows of weavers of the names of Fabry or Ovington.
  There is a tradition in the parish that this money was originally left
  for the support of cats and dogs, but it is more probable that it was
  originally intended, as in the cases above mentioned, to "whip dogs and
  cats" out of the church during divine service, and that on the unforeseen
  increase in the fund after a lapse of years, it became appropriated in
  the present way. This money was the subject of a chancery suit in the
  last century, and the decree therein directed the present division.</p>

  <p>Many of your readers will call to mind the yelp of some poor cur who
  had strolled through the open door of a country church on some sultry
  day, and been ejected by the sexton. I myself have often listened to the
  pit-a-pat in the quiet aisle, and I once remember a disturbance in church
  caused by the quarrel of two dogs. Such scenes, and the fact that dogs
  were considered unclean animals, most likely gave rise to the occupation
  of dog-whipper as a function of the sexton. It will also be remembered
  that some dogs cannot forbear a howl at the sound of certain musical
  instruments; and besides the simple inconvenience to the congregation,
  this howl may have been considered a manifestation of antipathy to holy
  influences, as the devil was supposed to fear holy water.</p>

  <p>Landseer's well-known picture of "The Free Church" proves to us that
  amongst the Highland shepherds the office does not now at least exist:
  and amongst other instances of the regular attendance at church of these
  "unclean animals," I know one in Wales where a favourite dog always
  accompanied his master to church, and stood up in the corner of the pew,
  keeping watch over the congregation with the strictest decorum.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">A Notary.</span></p>

  <p>That persons bearing an office described by such a name were attached
  to great houses in the sixteenth century, is clear from the well-known
  passage in <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, Act IV. Sc. 4., where
  Launce says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab;
  and goes me to the <i>fellow that whips the dogs</i>: 'Friend,' quoth I,
  'you mean to whip the dog?' 'Ay, marry do I,' quoth he," &amp;c.</p>

<h3>CEPHAS, A BINDER, AND NOT A ROCK.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 368.)</p>

  <p>I hope you will allow me to give a few reasons for dissenting from
  <span class="sc">Mr. Margoliouth</span>. I will promise to spare your
  space and avoid controversy.</p>

  <p>1. The Hebrew word <i>Caphis</i> is only to be found in Hab. ii. 11.
  Hence it has been regarded as of somewhat uncertain signification.
  However, by comparison with the Syrian verb <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="KPS" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5E4;&#x5E1;</bdo></span>&#x200E;
  (<i>c'phas</i>), we infer that it may denote that which <i>grasps</i>,
  <i>gathers</i>, or <i>holds together</i>; it is therefore not synonymous
  with <span title="deô" class="grk">&delta;&#x1F73;&omega;</span>, which
  is to <i>bind</i>, and is used in Matt. xvi. 19.</p>

  <p>2. Proper names from the Hebrew, Chaldee, and Syriac, are generally
  written in Greek, with the terminations of that language, as <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>
  Jesus, John, James, Thomas, Judas, &amp;c., and these terminations are
  <i>added</i> to the radical letters of the name, which are all retained.
  It is easy to see that <i>Caphis</i> would become <i>Caphisus</i>, while
  <i>Cepho</i> (Syriac for <i>rock</i>) would become <i>Cephas</i>, just as
  <i>Ehudo</i> (Syriac, <i>Jude</i>) becomes <i>Judas</i>.</p>

  <p>3. Still less likely would the name <i>Caphis</i> be to lose a radical
  in its transfer to the Syriac, where Cephos is represented by
  <i>Cepho</i>, without <i>s</i>.</p>

  <p>4. The paronomasia exhibited in the Latin, "Tu es <i>Petrus</i>, et
  super hanc <i>petram</i>," also appears both in the Greek and the
  Syriac.</p>

  <p>5. The difference of gender between the words <i>Petrus</i> and
  <i>petra</i>, moreover, is preserved in the Syriac and appears in the
  Greek.</p>

  <p>6. The figure of binding and loosing (v. 19.) is one which was common
  to the three languages, Greek, Chaldee, and Syriac, in all of which it
  denotes "to remit or retain" sins, "to confirm or abolish" a law,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>7. The occurrence of this figure in ch. xviii. 18., where the
  reference is not special to Peter, but general to all the apostles.
  (Compare John xx. 23.)</p>

  <p>8. The Syriac uniformly translates the name Peter by Cepho
  (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Cephas), except once or twice in Peter's epistles. This at
  least indicates their view of its meaning.</p>

  <p>On the whole I see no reason to suppose that Cephas means anything but
  <i>stone</i>; certainly there is much less reason for the proposed
  signification of <i>binder</i>.</p>

  <p>In John i. 42., the clause which explains the name Cephas is absent
  from the Syriac version in accordance with the regular and necessary
  practice of the translators to avoid tautology: "Thou shalt be called
  <i>Stone</i>; which is by interpretation <i>Stone!</i>" (See the
  <i>Journal of Sacred Literature</i> for January last, p. 457., for
  several examples of this.) There is here surely sufficient reason to
  account for the omission of this clause, which, it <!-- Page 501 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page501"></a>{501}</span>appears, is supported
  by universal MS. authority, as well as by that of the other versions.</p>

  <p class="author">B. H. C.</p>

  <p>The paronomasia of <i>Kipho</i> (=Rock) was made in the Syro-Chaldaic
  tongue, the vernacular language of our Lord and his disciples. The
  apostle John, writing in Greek (i. 43.), explains the meaning of
  <i>Kipho</i> (<span title="Kêphas" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&eta;&phi;&#x1FB6;&sigmaf;</span>) by the usual Greek phrase
  <span title="ho hermêneuetai Petros" class="grk">&#x1F45;
  &#x1F11;&rho;&mu;&eta;&nu;&epsilon;&#x1F7B;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;
  &Pi;&#x1F73;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, which phrase was
  necessarily omitted in the Syriac version, where this word <i>Kipho</i>
  was significant, in the original sense, as used by our Lord, and
  therefore needed no such hermeneutic explanation. Had our Lord spoken in
  Greek, and had the name <span title="Kêphas" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&eta;&phi;&#x1FB6;&sigmaf;</span> been <i>idem sonans</i> with
  <span lang="he" class="heb" title="KPYS" ><bdo

  11.)&mdash;which, however, is not the case,&mdash;some slender support
  might have been thereby afforded to <span class="sc">Mr.
  Margoliouth's</span> argument; but as he admits that our Lord did
  <i>not</i> speak in the Greek tongue, such argument falls to the ground
  as void of all probability.</p>

<h3>WHITTINGTON'S STONE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 397.)</p>

  <p>The disappearance of this celebrated memorial of a questionable
  legend, seems to have been satisfactorily accounted for. The newspapers
  inform us that it has been taken to a mason's yard for the purpose of
  reparation.</p>

  <p>Those who lament the removal of the stone on which, as they imagine,
  the runaway apprentice sat listening to the bells of Cheap, will perhaps
  be surprised to hear that the object of their regret is at least the
  <i>third</i> of the stones which have successively stood upon the spot
  long since the days of Whittington.</p>

  <p>1. In a learned and interesting paper communicated to the pages of
  <i>Sylvanus Urban</i> (G.&nbsp;M. Dec. 1852) by T.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;T. (a well-known and
  respected local antiquary, who will yet, it is sincerely hoped, enrich
  our libraries with a work on the ancient history of the northern suburbs,
  a task for which he is pre-eminently qualified), it is shown that in all
  probability the site in question was once occupied by a wayside cross,
  belonging to the formerly adjacent lazar-house and chapel of St. Anthony.
  A certain engraving of 1776, mentioned by Mr. T., and which is now before
  me, represents a small obelisk or pyramid standing upon a square base,
  and surmounted by a cross, apparently of iron. The stone (popularly
  regarded as the original) was removed in 1795 by "one S&mdash;&mdash;,"
  the surveyor of the roads. Having been broken, or as another account
  states, sawn in two, the halves were placed as curb-stones against the
  posts on each side of Queen's Head Lane in the Lower Street. (Nelson's
  <i>Hist. of Islington</i>, 1811, p. 102.; <i>Gent. Mag.</i>, Sept. and
  Oct. 1824, pp. 200. 290.; Lewis's <i>Hist. of Islington</i>, 1841, p.
  286.) In <i>Adams's Picturesque Guide to the Environs of London</i>, by
  E.&nbsp;L. Blanchard (a recent but dateless little work, which I chanced to
  open at a book-stall a day or two ago), the present Queen's Head tavern
  in the Lower Street is mentioned as containing certain relics of its
  predecessor, "with the real Whittington stone (it is said) for a
  threshold."</p>

  <p>2. Shortly after the removal of this supposed "original," a new
  memorial was erected, with the inscription "Whittington's Stone." This
  was, for some cause, removed by order of the churchwardens in May,
  1821.</p>

  <p>3. In his second edition, 1823, Nelson says, "The present stone was
  set up in 1821, by the trustees of the parish ways." This is the stone
  which has lately been removed.</p>

  <p>I have given the development according to the plan usually followed,
  for the sake of comparison; but where it is desirable to work out the
  shadows fully, it is far better to give longer exposure in the camera
  (three times that above given), and develop with gallo-nitrate of the
  strength used to excite, finishing with gallic acid. The time varies with
  the subject; a cottage among trees requiring 12 to 14 minutes. Almost all
  the statements I have seen, giving the time, do so absolutely; it is well
  to remind photographers, that these convey no <i>information
  whatever</i>, unless the focal length for parallel rays, and the diameter
  of the diaphragm, are also given: the time, in practice as well as in
  theory, varying (<i>cæteris paribus</i>) directly as the <!-- Page 502
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page502"></a>{502}</span>square of the
  former, and inversely as the square of the latter; and, without these
  corrections, the results of one lens are not comparable with those of
  another.</p>

  <p>When shall we get a good structureless paper? The <i>texture</i> of
  Turner's, especially his new paper, is a great defect; and its skies are
  thin, <i>very</i> inferior to the dense velvety blacks obtained with
  Whatman's of old date&mdash;a paper now extinct, and one which,
  unfortunately for us, it seems impossible to reproduce.</p>

  <p><i>Conversion of Calotype Negatives into Positives.</i>&mdash;At the
  second meeting of the British Association at York, Professor Grove
  described a process by which a negative calotype might be converted into
  a positive one, by drawing an ordinary calotype image over iodide of
  potassium and dilute nitric acid, and exposing to a full sunshine. Not
  being able to find the proportions in any published work, can any of your
  numerous readers give me the required information; and whether the
  photograph should be exposed in its damp state, or allowed to dry?</p>

  <p><i>Albumenized Paper.</i>&mdash;Mr. Spencer, in the last number of the
  <i>Photographic Journal</i>, in describing a mode of preparing
  albumenized paper, states he has never found it necessary to iron it, as
  the silver solution coagulates the albumen the moment it comes in contact
  with it, "and I fancy makes it print more evenly than when heat has been
  employed." But Mr. Spencer uses a nitrate of silver solution of 90 or 100
  grains to the ounce, while <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span> recommends
  40 grains. Now as it is very desirable to get rid of the ironing if
  possible, my Query is, Will the 40-grain solution coagulate the albumen
  so as to do away with that troublesome process?</p>

  <p><i>Female Dress</i> (Vol. ix., p. 271.).&mdash;I have dresses from
  1768 to the present time, two or three years only missing, from
  pocket-books, which I have carefully arranged and had bound in a volume.
  On referring to it I find that hoops ceased after 1786, excepting for
  court days. The ladies at that time wore large hats, the same shape young
  people and children have at the present day. Powder went out at the time
  of the scarcity, patches before hoops, and high-heeled shoes when short
  waists came in fashion.</p>

  <p>I have a small engraving of their Majesties, attended by the lord
  chamberlain, &amp;c., together with the Princess Royal, Prince Edward,
  and the Princess Elizabeth, in their boxes at the opera in the year 1782.
  The queen in a very large hoop, each with their hair full powdered; and
  the celebrated Mademoiselle Theodore, in the favourite comic ballad
  called "Les Petits Reins," the same year, with a large hoop, hair well
  powdered, a little hat at the back of her head with long strings, very
  short petticoats, and shoes with buckles.</p>

  <p><i>Office of Sexton held by one Family</i> (Vol. ix., p.
  171.).&mdash;A search into parish registers would, I think, show that the
  office of clerk was often a hereditary one. In Worcestershire, for
  example, the family of Rose at Bromsgrove, and the family of Osborne at
  Belbroughton, have supplied hereditary clerks to those parishes through
  many generations. In the latter case, also, the trade of a tailor has
  also been hereditary to an Osborne, in conjunction with his duties as
  clerk. The Mr. Tristram, who was the patron of the living of Belbroughton
  (afterwards sold to St. John's College, Oxford), states, in a letter to
  the bishop (Lyttelton), that the Osbornes were tailors in Belbroughton in
  the reign of Henry VIII. They are tailors, as well as clerks, to this
  day, but they can trace their descent to a period of more than <!-- Page
  503 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page503"></a>{503}</span>three
  centuries before Henry VIII. The office of parish clerk and sexton has
  also been hereditary in the parishes of Hope and King's Norton,
  Worcestershire.</p>

  <p><i>Lyra's Commentary</i> (Vol. ix., p. 323.).&mdash;The human figure
  described by <span class="sc">Edward Peacock</span> as impressed on one
  cover of his curious old copy of the <i>Textus biblie</i>, &amp;c., has
  no glory round the head, or over it, by his account. This would warrant
  the conclusion that it was not intended for any saint, or it might almost
  pass for a St. Christopher. But I believe it is meant as emblematic of a
  Christian generally, in his passage through this life. I suspect that
  what <span class="sc">Mr. Peacock</span> speaks of as a "fence composed
  of interlaced branches of trees," is intended to represent waves of water
  by undulating lines. The figure appears to be wading through the waters
  of the tribulations of this life, by the help of his staff, just as St.
  Christopher is represented. This may account for the loose appearance of
  his nether habiliments, which are tucked up, so as to leave the knees
  bare. The wallet is a very fit accompaniment for the pilgrim's staff. The
  wicker basket holds his more precious goods; but, to show the insecurity
  of their tenure, the pilgrim has a sword ready for their defence.</p>

  <p>It is not so easy to account for the animals on the other cover. My
  conjecture is, that at least the four lower ones are meant for the
  emblematic figures of the four evangelists. The bird may be the eagle,
  the monkey the man; the dog may, on closer scrutiny, be found to look
  something like the ox or calf; and the lion speaks for itself. But I can
  attempt no explanation of the upper figures, which <span class="sc">Mr.
  Peacock</span> says "may be horses." I should much like to see drawings
  of the whole, both human and animal, having a great predilection for
  studying such puzzles. But if the above hints prove of any service, it
  will gratify</p>

  <p><i>Blackguard</i> (Vol. vii., p. 77. Vol. viii., p. 414.).&mdash;Many
  contributions towards the history of this word have appeared in the pages
  of "N. &amp; Q." May I forward another instance of its being in early
  use, although not altogether in its modern acceptation?</p>

  <p>A copy of a medical work in my possession (a 12mo., printed in 1622,
  and in the original binding) has fly-leaves from some <i>printed</i>
  book, as is often the case in volumes of that date. These fly-leaves seem
  to be part of some descriptive sketches of different classes of society,
  published towards the early part of the seventeenth century; and some of
  your readers may be able to identify the work from my description of
  these of sheets. No. 14. is headed "An unworthy Judge;" 16. "An unworthy
  Knight and Souldier;" 17. "A worthy Gentleman;" 18. "An unworthy
  Gentleman," &amp;c. At p 13., No. 27., occurs "A Bawde of the Blacke
  Guard," with her description in about sixteen lines. She is said to be
  "well verst in the black art, to accommodate them of the black guard: a
  weesel-look't gossip she is in all places, where herr mirth is a bawdy
  tale," and so on.</p>

  <p>Judging from these fly-leaves, the work from which they have been
  taken appears to have been an octavo or small quarto. "Finis" stands on
  the reverse of the leaf whence my extract is copied.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Jaydee.</span></p>

  <p>Another instance of the use of the word <i>black-guard</i>, in the
  sense given to it in "N. &amp; Q." (Vol. ii., pp. 170. 285.), is to be
  found in Burton's <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, part i. sect. 2., "A
  Digression of the Nature of Spirits, bad Angels, or Devils, &amp;c.," in
  a passage, part of which is given as a quotation. "Generally they far
  excel men in worth, as a man the meanest worme;" though some of then are
  "inferior to those of their own rank in worth, as the <i>black-guard</i>
  of a prince's court, and to men again, as some degenerate, base, rational
  creatures are excelled of brute beasts." The edition of Burton I quote
  from is 1652.</p>

  >&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;&gamma;&eta;</span>,
  used by Æschylus and Demosthenes, occurs 2 Cor. v. 19., Rom. xi. 15. v.
  11. The word <i>atonement</i> bears two senses: the first,
  <i>reconciliation</i>, as used by Sir Thomas More, Shakspeare, Beaumont
  and Fletcher, and Bishops Hall and Taylor; the second, <i>expiation</i>,
  as employed by Milton, Swift, and Cowper. In the latter meaning, we find
  it in Numbers, and other books of the Old Testament, as the translation

  <p>Waterland speaks of "the doctrine of expiation, atonement, or
  satisfaction, made by Christ in His blood" (<i>Disc. of Fundamentals</i>,
  vol. v. p. 82.). Barrow, Secker, and Beveridge use the word <i>atone</i>
  or <i>atonement</i> in this combined sense of the term. R. Gloucester,
  Chaucer, and Dryden expressly speak "at one," in a similar way; and, <!--

  <p><i>Bible of 1527</i> (Vol. ix., p. 352.).&mdash;In reference to the

  very similar, among the "mason marks" on Strasburg Tower, which would
  seem a place of Freemason pilgrimage: for the soft stone is deeply carved
  in various places within the tower with such marks as this, together with
  initials and dates of visit. I have also marks very similar from the
  stones of the tower of the pretty little cathedral of Freiburg, Briesgau.
  I should incline to think it a Masonic mark, and not that of an engraver
  on wood, or of a printer.</p>

  that day. It is commonly called the "Pancake Bell," because it was also
  the signal for the cook to put the pancake on the fire. This savoury

  well have extended his amendment, and suggested <i>ad verbum et

  the word <i>verbatim</i> being used in the Latin language, as for that of
  <i>literatim</i>. Vossius is an authority for the latter; but can any of
  your correspondents oblige me by citing one for the former,
  notwithstanding its frequent adoption in English conversation and
  writings? Neither <i>verbatim</i> nor <i>literatim</i> will be found in
  Riddle.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>In days like these, when so many of our new books are but old ones
  newly dressed up, a work of original research, and for which the
  materials have been accumulated by the writer with great labour and
  diligence, deserves especial commendation. Of such a character is the
  <i>Catholic History of England; its Rulers, Clergy, and Poor, before the
  Reformation, as described by the Monkish Historians</i>, by Bernard
  William MacCabe, of which the third volume, extending from the reign of
  Edward Martyr to the Norman Conquest, has just been published. The
  volumes bear evidence in every page that they are, as the author
  describes them, "the results of the writing and research of many
  hours&mdash;the only hours for many years that I had to spare from other
  and harder toils." Himself a zealous and sincere follower of the "ancient
  faith," Mr. MacCabe's views of the characters and events of which he is
  treating, naturally assume the colouring of his own mind: many,
  therefore, will dissent from them. None of his readers will, however,
  dissent from bestowing upon his work the praise of being carefully
  compiled and most originally written. None will deny the charm with which
  Mr. MacCabe has invested his History, by his admirable mode of making the
  old Monkish writers tell their own story. <!-- Page 505 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page505"></a>{505}</span></p>

  <p>We some time since called the attention of our readers to a new
  periodical which had been commenced at Göttingen, under the title of
  <i>Zeitschrift für Deutsche Mythologie und Sittenkunde</i>, under the
  editorship of T.&nbsp;W. Wolf. We have since received the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
  Parts of it from Messrs. Williams and Norgate, and hope shortly to
  transfer from its pages to our columns a few of the many curious
  illustrations of our own Folk Lore, with which it abounds.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>The Works of John
  Locke</i>, vol. i., <i>Philosophical Works, with a preliminary Essay and
  Notes</i>, by J.&nbsp;A. St. John, is the first volume of a collected edition
  of the writings of this distinguished English philosopher, intended to
  form a portion of Bohn's <i>Standard Library</i>.&mdash;<i>The Diary and
  Letters of Madame D'Arblay</i>, vol. iv., 1788-89. Worth more than its
  cost for its pictures of Fox, Burke, Wyndham, &amp;c., and Hastings'
  Impeachment.&mdash;<i>A Poet's Children</i>, by Patrick Scott. A
  shilling's worth of miscellaneous poems from the pen of this imaginative
  but somewhat eccentric bard.&mdash;<i>Points of War, I. II. III. IV.</i>,
  by Franklin Lushington. Mr. Lushington is clearly an admirer of Tennyson,
  and has caught not a little of the mannerism and not a few of the graces
  of his great model.</p>

  Specially rewarded with medals by the Governments of Belgium and the

  Continent, in consequence of its proved superior power and
  efficacy&mdash;effecting a cure much more rapidly. Contains iodine,
  phosphate of chalk, volatile acid, and the elements of the bile&mdash;in
  short, all its most active and essential principles&mdash;in larger
  quantities than the pale oils made in England and Newfoundland, deprived
  mainly of these by their mode of preparation. A pamphlet by Dr. de Jongh,

  <p>SOUTHGATE &amp; BARRETT have received instructions from MR. HOGARTH,
  of the Haymarket, to Sell by Public Auction at their Fine Art and Book
  Auction Rooms, 22. Fleet Street, London, on Wednesday Evening, June 7th,
  and following Evenings,</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE WHOLE OF THE REMAINING
COPIES</p>

<p class="cenhead">Of the very Celebrated Work, known as</p>

<h3>FINDEN'S ROYAL GALLERY OF
BRITISH ART,</h3>

  <p>Consisting of a limited number of Artists' and other choice proofs,
  and the print impressions, which are all in an exceedingly fine state.
  The work consists of 48 plates, the whole of which are engraved in line
  by the most eminent men in that branch of art, and the pictures selected
  will at once show that the great artists&mdash;Turner, Eastlake,
  Landseer, Stanfield, Webster, Roberts, Wilkie, Maclise, Mulready, and
  more than thirty other British Masters, are represented by the works
  which established and upheld them in public favour, and by themes which
  appeal to universal sympathy and happiest affections, or which delineate
  the peculiar glories of our country, and commemorate its worthiest and
  most honourable achievements.</p>

  <p>The attention of the public is also particularly directed to the fact
  that ALL THE ENGRAVED PLATES from which the impressions now offered have
  been taken, WILL BE DESTROYED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PURCHASERS, at the
  time of Sale. By thus securing the market from being supplied with
  inferior impressions at a future time, and at a cheaper rate, the value
  of the existing stock will be increased, and it will become the interest
  of all who wish to possess copies of these eminent works of art, at a
  reduced price, to purchase them at this Sale, which will be THE ONLY
  OPPORTUNITY of obtaining them.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances, therefore, SOUTHGATE &amp; BARRETT presume
  to demand for this Sale the attention of all lovers of art&mdash;the
  amateur, the artist, and the public:&mdash;believing that no opportunity
  has ever offered so happily calculated to promote taste and to extend
  knowledge, while ministering to the purest and best enjoyments which the
  artist conveys to the hearts and homes of all who covet intellectual
  pleasures.</p>

  <p>Framed Copies of the work can be seen at MR. HOGARTH'S, 5. Haymarket;
  MESSRS. LLOYD, BROTHERS, &amp; CO., 22. Ludgate Hill; and at the
  AUCTIONEERS, 22. Fleet Street, by whom all Communications and Commissions
  will be promptly and faithfully attended to.</p>
